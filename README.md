# Absenteeism_At_Work_Project

### Step1: Created a predictictive model in python which can predict absenteeism and deployed on localhost
### Step2: Load the prediction result in MySQL database for visualization purpose
### Step3: Imported the prediction data from database to a csv file and visualized in Tableau. From viz, We can see live prediction when the api is running on localhost. 

#### Introduction:
What is Absenteeism?
Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation without good reason. Generally, absenteeism is unplanned absences.Absenteeism has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an implicit contract between employee and employer. It is seen as a management problem, and framed in economic or quasi-economic terms.

Problem:
The problem is that the work environment of today is more:
* Competitive
* Managers set unachievable business goals 
* have an elevated risk of becoming unemployed
This can be lead to an increase in pressure and stress of the employee. Those factors influence employee health, which is of-course indesirable.

Objective: High absenteeism among employees can be detrimental to an organization as it can result in productivity and economic loss. In this case study we are trying to understand and predict absenteeism. Understanding this would provide human resource managers an excellent decision aid to create policies that can aim to reduce absenteeism.

This case study is based on the "Absenteeism at work" dataset from UCI.

The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.

The goal is to create a predictive model which can predict absenteeism i.e. whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not, based on information like:

* How many children and pets they have?
* How far they live from their workplace? 
* Do they have higher education?
